❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add two variables, `a` and `b`, but these variables are not defined within the
function scope, nor are they passed as arguments. This will lead to an error when the function is executed because `a`
and `b` are undefined.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, limiting its reusability.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are used in the addition operation.
* ✔️ The function becomes reusable as it can now sum any two numbers passed to it.
* ✔️ No longer relies on variables in the outer scope, making the function more predictable and less prone to errors.

Final Note:
Always ensure functions explicitly define their dependencies, preferably through parameters. This makes the code more
self-contained, readable, and less prone to errors caused by external variable changes.
